**VisMimic: Integrating Motion Chain in Feedback Video Generation for Motor Coaching** 

​	| State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University								*Nov. 2024 – Mar. 2025*

* Contributed to a 3D modeling and analysis system for coaching human motion videos. 
* Currently submitted to **UIST** 
* **Responsibilities:**
    * Utilized the `gvhmr` model for `smplx` modeling of motion videos.
    * Developed a `three.js`-based GLB file viewer for 3D scene rendering.
    * Designed and implemented the frontend system interface using `Vue`, including playback control and interaction for 3D models and 2D image sequences.

**RL2Path: Efficient Expert-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Safe Local Path Planning** 

​	| State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University   						        *Feb. 2025 – Mar. 2025*

* Aimed to achieve local obstacle avoidance path planning for wheeled robots using reinforcement learning. The model, ignited by `PC-Planner`, directly outputs planned paths rather than low-level control commands, enhancing training and control efficiency and robustness. 
* Currently submitted to **IROS 2025**
* **Responsibilities:**
    * Established the `ROS2` simulation environment.
    * Reproduced and simulated the `PathRL` paper's approach.

**Embodied AI Project: Tour Guide Robot at Unitree Robotics** | Hangzhou	             *Apr. 2025 – June 2025*

* Developed a tour guide robot on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot, enabling autonomous navigation and interaction driven by large language models.
* **Responsibilities:**
  * Configured and established **ROS2** environment and robot communication systems on the server.
  * Implemented and deployed 3D point cloud-based SLAM algorithms (`slam_toolbox`, `cartographer`) and the `nav2` navigation system.
  * Gained familiarity with `Isaac Sim` (`Isaac Gym`) environment setup and reinforcement learning training pipelines.
